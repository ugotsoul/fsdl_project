## Ideas
Two topics I am interested replicating from wandb benchmarks:

- super resolution: https://wandb.ai/wandb/superres/benchmark

- poverty mapping with satellite data: https://wandb.ai/thinkingmachines/ph-poverty-mapping/benchmark

Other topics I'm interested in:

- Building and deploying a GAN similar to using my own drawings or other open sourced art I've gathered as a dataset
  - Ideas for datasets: protest signs, propaganda posters, gritty (eg., japanese product or sports mascots?), african masks  

- Object detection: 
  - Curb cuts for accessiblity or piles of trash from satellite imagery 
  - Using a webcam video source: poor posture, face touching, or cleanched jaw.
  - Using a webcam: hornet activity (or bird activity?) in backyard

- Handwriting recognition / OCR
  - Graffiti text
  - Husband's writing

- Super resolution 
  - Old cartoons
  - Vintage clothing
  - Drawings


Alternate projects:

- Contribute to fastai library
- Contribute to stylegan / stylegan-ada fork
  
Tooling:
- Mlflow
- Docker
- AWS/GCP
- Streamlit

Project Goal:

What dataset will you use, or how do you plan to collect data? 

What baseline will you use? 

What model architecture / loss function do you propose? 

What will the end result look like?
